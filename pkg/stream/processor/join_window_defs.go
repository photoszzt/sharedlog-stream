/**
 * The window specifications used for joins.
 *
 * A {@code JoinWindows} instance defines a maximum time difference for a {@link KStream#join(KStream, ValueJoiner,
 * JoinWindows) join over two streams} on the same key.
 * In SQL-style you would express this join as
 * {@code
 *     SELECT * FROM stream1, stream2
 *     WHERE
 *       stream1.key = stream2.key
 *       AND
 *       stream1.ts - before <= stream2.ts AND stream2.ts <= stream1.ts + after
 * }
 * There are three different window configuration supported:
 *
 *     - before = after = time-difference
 *     - before = 0 and after = time-difference
 *     - before = time-difference and after = 0
 *
 * A join is symmetric in the sense, that a join specification on the first stream returns the same result record as
 * a join specification on the second stream with flipped before and after values.
 *
 * Both values (before and after) must not result in an "inverse" window, i.e., upper-interval bound cannot be smaller
 * than lower-interval bound.
 *
 * {@code JoinWindows} are sliding windows, thus, they are aligned to the actual record timestamps.
 * This implies, that each input record defines its own window with start and end time being relative to the record's
 * timestamp.
