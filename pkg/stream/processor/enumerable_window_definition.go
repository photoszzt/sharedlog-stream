//
// The window specification for windows that can be enumerated for a single event based on its time.
//
// Grace period defines how long to wait on out-of-order events. That is, windows will continue to accept new records until {@code stream_time >= window_end + grace_period}.
// Records that arrive after the grace period passed are considered <em>late</em> and will not be processed but are dropped.
//
// Window state is stored until it is no longer needed, measured from the beginning of the window. To assist the store in not discarding window state too soon, this definition
// also includes a maxSize(), indicating the longest span windows can have between their start and end. This does not need to include the grace period.
